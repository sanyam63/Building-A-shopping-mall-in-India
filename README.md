# Building a shopping mall
Building a shopping mall at a correct place in India using machine learning clustering algorithm K means and Foursquare API.

First of all, we will do data scraping to check the biggest mall in India. We will extract the data into a table to conclude that 
Delhi is not in the list. We will then use foursquare API, folium and other packages in this project. Read the report or see 
the presentation detailed explaination.

The map does not seem to load, execute the notebook to see the folium map or view the report.
